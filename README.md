lockdown story writing online

This project is about the coding of a game, collaborative, for anyone wanting to add his/her own line to a story ...

The game is about adding a line to some existing unknown narrative, previously written and stored.

The end happens once, a certain number of lines is achieved, initially preset, then, updated by writers.

Example, a preset is set to 100 lines, but writers updated to more lines, democratically, converging to an end.
Example, 100+1000 * 0.5 = 450, 450+50 * 0.5 = 250, ...

Or, a maximum number of lines criterion is also set. Examples: War and Peace, Tolstoy, 365 chapters, 587287 words, “Baby Shoes” by Hemingway, six-word story.
